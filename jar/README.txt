If jar files are not already present or if the current jar files throw errors, it may be necessary to compile a new version of the jar files on your machine. To compile the .jar files on a windows operating system, run the MakeJars.ps1 powershell script. This may require a Java Development Kit (such as the one at https://openjdk.org/) to be installed. The current code has been verified to run with openJDK 21 (https://jdk.java.net/21/). Instructions for installing openJDK can be found here (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52511778/how-to-install-openjdk-11-on-windows).
