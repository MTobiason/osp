//	IN_FIXED_DOMAINS - Text file listing the fixed domains for the network. Each line should contain a single domain formated as DOMAIN-NAME <tab> BASE-SEQUENCE. Acceptable bases are A/T/C/G. 
IN_FIXED_DOMAINS	se_in_domains_fixed.txt

//	IN_VARIABLE_DOMAINS - Text file listing the variable domains for the network. Each line should contain a single domain formated as DOMAIN-NAME <tab> BASE-SEQUENCE. Acceptable bases are A/T/C/G. 
IN_VARIABLE_DOMAINS	se_in_domains_variable.txt

//	IN_OLIGOMERS - Text file listing the oligomers for the network. Each line should contain a single oligomer formated as an OLIGOMER-NAME, <tab>, then a list of domain-names or domain-name complements. Complements are denoted by prepending c. to a domain name. Convention is to list the 5' most domain first.
