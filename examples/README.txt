Several example input files are included in this directory. This includes:

1. Input files for the autocatalytic network published in "Engineering Entropy-Driven Reactions and Networks Catalyzed by DNA" by Zhang et al. (https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1148532).
2. Input files for the "4-input-or" network published in "Scaling up digital circuit computation with DNA strand displacement cascades" by Qian and Winfree (https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1200520).
3. Input files for the autocatalytic network published in "Multi-Arm Junctions for Dynamic DNA Nanotechnology" by Kotani et al. (https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.7b00530).
4. Input files for the "10x10x10 molecular canvas" published in "Three-dimensional structures self-assembled from DNA bricks" by Ke et al. (https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1227268).

To run any of these examples: 
	(1) Compile the jar files by following the directions in "jar\README.txt".
	(2) Navigate to the folder containing the example's se_parameters.txt.
	(3) Run the command "java -jar ..\..\jar\SeqEvo.jar". This should print text to the console screen and create several files in the "output" directory.
	(4) Run the command "java -jar ..\..\jar\DevPro.jar". This should print text to the console screen and create several files in the "output" directory.
